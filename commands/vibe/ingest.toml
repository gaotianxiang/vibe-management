CONTEXT INGESTION REQUEST

Project canon:
@{vibe/02_CONTEXT.md}
@{vibe/04_DECISIONS.md}
@{vibe/07_CHANGELOG.md}

New material (raw) provided by user:
{{args}}

TASK:
1) Summarize the material (5–12 bullets).
2) Decide what belongs in:
   - vibe/02_CONTEXT.md (only if always-needed invariant)
   - vibe/SOURCES/src_XXXX_<topic>.md (detailed distilled notes)
   - vibe/04_DECISIONS.md (only if it implies/forces a decision)
3) PROPOSE unified diffs for the affected markdown files:
   - Create a new SOURCES file if needed
   - Update vibe/02_CONTEXT.md with links only
4) Add a short entry proposal for vibe/07_CHANGELOG.md describing the new context added.

IMPORTANT:
- Only propose diffs. Do not apply edits.
- Keep vibe/02_CONTEXT.md small.
